        <p>Environmenatlsim can seem like a intense practice that is not accessible to everyday people. At the beginning of my environmental journey, I began to see how being eco-friendly wasn't as easy as it should be, and how it can be overwhelming, even discouraging. I created this site so people have a simple guide to living a little more green. This is our only home, and we owe it to the Earth to try and be as kind and gentle as we can!</p>
