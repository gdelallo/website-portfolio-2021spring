<p>Environmenatlism is a conservation movement aimed at preserving and protecting all of Earth's ecosystems, enabling them to continually thrive. This movement is based in the belief that humans and nature should not only coexist, but should exist within a symbiotic-relationship where both parties thrive. Nature gives us most of the elements necessary to our surviuval, and environmentalists recognize this. It is illogical to continually destroy our only home and expect it to withstand 250+ years of abuse. Within this movement, environmentalism aims to educate those who are ignorant to the severe environmental crisis facing our planet, and empower all people to fight for the health of our planet. Afterall, a healthy planet will contribute to the quality of life all 7.7 billion humans expereince. </p>
