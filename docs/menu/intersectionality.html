<p> Environmentalism, also know as environmental rights,

<p class="racism"> The term "Environmental Racism" began to advance in public discourse following the global, 2020 Black Lives Matter Movement sparked by the unjust murders of unarmed Black people within the United States. Despite its now-established presence, the term was coined in 1982 by Benjamin Chavis. Chavis described the discrimination as "racial discrimination in environmental policy-making, the enforcement of regulations and laws, the deliberate targeting of communities of colour for toxic waste facilities, the official sanctioning of the life-threatening presence of poisons and pollutants in our communities, and the history of excluding people of colour from leadership of the ecology movements." Although this concept has been known about for nearly 40 years, the issue is still as urgent as ever.
Within the United States alone, there is environmental racism in every state across the country.
