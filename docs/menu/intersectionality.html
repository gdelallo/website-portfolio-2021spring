<h1> Equality within the Environment </h1>

<p class="moreinfo"> Intersectional environmentalism is an inclusive term to describe a type of environmentalism that aims to not only bring justice to the Earth, but also the people. For decades, BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) communities all over the worlds have been subjected to discrimatory practices. Most often these enforcements have resulted in these people living within an environment that negatively impact their health and quality of life. This occurs while the dominate classes are able to adapt their surrounds from the harshest effects of climate change. Communities of color, poor communities, and native and indeigenous peoples are the ones most effected by climate change, but are often left out of the conversation. This is an issue refered to as <e><i>Environmental Racism</i></e>. ER began to advance in public discourse following the global, 2020 Black Lives Matter Movement sparked by the unjust murders of unarmed Black people within the United States. Despite its now-established presence, the term was coined in 1982 by Benjamin Chavis. Chavis described the discrimination as "racial discrimination in environmental policy-making, the enforcement of regulations and laws, the deliberate targeting of communities of colour for toxic waste facilities, the official sanctioning of the life-threatening presence of poisons and pollutants in our communities, and the history of excluding people of colour from leadership of the ecology movements." Although this concept has been known about for nearly 40 years, the issue is still as urgent as ever. Within the United States alone, there is environmental racism in every region, and some of the greatest injustices are diretly effecting people of color like <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/flint-water-crisis-everything-you-need-know"> the Flint Water Crisis</a>; <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardepstein/2019/04/08/the-indigenous-peoples-war-against-pipelines/?sh=32e28ef03781">the creation of pipelines on indigenous land</a>; and <a href="https://www.wri.org/blog/2020/10/pollution-racial-justice-issue"> elevated pollution in communities of color and poor communities</a>. When we look at the issue as a whole, we must frame disenfranchised peoples and communities at the center of the fight. Without regard for those who have suffered the most from humaniy's abusive treatment of the planet, there is mo way to effectively correct this grave situation.</p>
