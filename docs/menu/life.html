<h2>Easy Ways to</h2>
<img src='../media/gogreen.gif'/>
<p class="gogreen">Making changes to our everyday lives is one of the most effective things we can do in reducing our environmental impact. Whether it be cooking at home, composting, or buying organically, there are so many resources out there to help you on this journey! Below I have included my own tips, as well as tools and guides on how you can begin to build your green life. At the end of the day, we can only do so much since only 100 companies account for 71% of the world's carbon emissions, but we can always strive to reduce our waste, buy ethically, and put our money and efforts in the places that deserve it the most. Going green doesn't have to be hard, and it shouldn't! Making small changes over time will result in a big impact. That being said, be kind to yourself on this journey, because we are all trying to do our most imperfectly perfect best.</p>
