Hello and welcome to my website! I am excited to share a page that reflects something I am very passionate about and is a central theme in my life: environmentalism. Throughout this site, you can expect to learn and explore lots of new things, such as what environmentalism is, how must intersect with equality, how to be more eco-friendly, and how to get involved. I will also include suggestions on a multitude of things, like my favorite blog/newsletter, ethical eco brands, diy tips, and more. I hope this page helps inspire people to begin their transition to a greener lifestyle, because through meaningful collective action, we, together, can help to heal the planet.
