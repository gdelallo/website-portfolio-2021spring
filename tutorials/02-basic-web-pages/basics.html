    <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of
    headings.</p>
  </body>
<h2>Lists</h2>

<p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
 <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
 <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
 <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is
     an ordered list</li>
</ol>

<h2>Inline Elements</h2>

<p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or
phrase.</p>
